## Workflow
 1.  Find an exercise you're interested in solving
 2.  Create a solution
 3.  Go to the index.js located on the root folder of the language
 4.  Import the exercise file
  <br>Example:
  ``
  import "./exercise/basics/fibonacci.js"
  ``
  <br>Including the file extension
 5. Call the function and test your algorithm
  ``
  console.log(fibonacci(5))
  ``
  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```
 6. Once you're confident to your algorithm, Go to the tests directory at ./exercises/tests and run in your terminal
  ```bash
  mocha fibonacci.js
  ```
