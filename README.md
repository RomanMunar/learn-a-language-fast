# Work In Progress

---

The goal here is to quickly learn the fundamentals of a programming language to quickly get you up to speed and start working on projects.
<small>and not waste time reading _how to_ blogs</small> ðŸ˜‰

\*Please note that if you're a complete beginner learn the basics of programming first, the purpose of this exercises is to quickly get a grasp of the language.

Currently Supported languages:

- [Go](#go)
- [Javascript](#javascript)
- [Bash](#bash)
- [Python](#python)

Future Language:

- C/C++
- Rust
- Java
